    "# ðŸ“Š Bank Customer Churn Analysis - Summary Report\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## ðŸ§¾ Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis explores customers demographics, customers behaviour (account-wise), the factors influencing customer churn at the bank and evaluates the potential to predict which customers are at risk of leaving. Using historical customer data, a predictive model was built to identify key patterns tied to churn. Age, income level, credit score, account balance, and product usage emerged as the most important indicators of whether a customer is likely to exit. While the model is effective at identifying many churners, there is still room for improvement, especially in capturing all customers who may be considering leaving. Notably, some factors typically seen as less influential, like income, played a larger role in our customer base than expected. These insights provide a foundation for more targeted retention strategies and suggest that deeper behavioral data could further strengthen our ability to proactively reduce churn.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. What attributes are more common among churners than non-churners?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Credit Score**: Churners tend to have lower mean credit scores.\n",
    "- **Age**: Churners are typically older (ages 40â€“60).\n",
    "- **Tenure**: Customers with shorter tenures are more likely to churn.\n",
    "- **Balance**: Churners tend to maintain higher average balances.\n",
    "- **Products**: Customers with fewer bank products are more likely to churn.\n",
    "- **Active Membership**: Less active customers show higher churn rates.\n",
    "- **Churn Prediction**: Churn can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using the variables in the dataset. Based on the Random Forest model's feature importance analysis, Age is the strongest predictor, followed by EstimatedSalary, CreditScore, Balance, and NumOfProducts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ðŸ’¡ Inference:**  \n",
    "Focus retention strategies on older, high-balance, low-tenure, and less engaged customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What do the overall demographics of the bank's customers look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Age**: Most customers are aged 30â€“50; average age is ~38.\n",
    "- **Gender**: Slightly more males than females.\n",
    "- **Geography**: Most customers are from France, followed by Germany and Spain.\n",
    "- **Credit Score**: Generally ranges between 650â€“700.\n",
    "- **Balance & Salary**: Germany shows a higher average balance.\n",
    "- **Tenure**: Most customers have between 4 to 6 years of tenure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ðŸ’¡ Inference:**  \n",
    "The bank's primary customer base is mid-aged, moderately tenured, and financially stable, with France being the strongest market.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Differences in Behavior Across Germany, France, and Spain\n",
    "\n",
    "| Country  | Churn Rate | Avg Balance | Avg Tenure | Avg Credit Score | Engagement |\n",
    "|----------|------------|-------------|------------|------------------|------------|\n",
    "| France   | ~15%       | ~115k       | ~5.0 yrs   | ~660             | High       |\n",
    "| Germany  | ~35%       | ~125k       | ~6.2 yrs   | ~680             | Moderate   |\n",
    "| Spain    | ~18%       | ~112k       | ~4.3 yrs   | ~645             | Lower      |\n",
    "\n",
    "**ðŸ’¡ Inference:**  \n",
    "Germany has the most valuable but at-risk customers. France is the most stable market, while Spain presents growth potential with younger customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Customer Segments\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Segment 1: Loyal, Low Risk**  \n",
    "  Older, long-tenured, and high credit score customers. Low churn risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Segment 2: At-Risk Professionals**  \n",
    "  Mid-aged, moderately engaged customers with moderate churn risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Segment 3: Affluent but Unhappy**  \n",
    "  High earners with good financial standing (often German) but high churn rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Segment 4: Young & Unengaged**  \n",
    "  Recently joined, low-product customers. Low current value, but high growth potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ðŸ’¡ Inference:**  \n",
    "Apply targeted strategies to improve engagement, loyalty rewards, and cross-sell products per segment.\n",

    "## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Demographic Distribution by Country and Gender\n",
    "- **France** has the highest number of customers.\n",
    "- **Gender distribution** is balanced but slightly skewed toward males across all countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Age and Tenure Trends\n",
    "- **Germany** has older customers; **Spain** has a younger population.\n",
    "- **Tenure** is more balanced in France; most Spanish and German customers have â‰¤5 years with the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Behavioral Patterns (Country-Specific)\n",
    "- **Product usage**: Most customers use 1â€“2 products.\n",
    "- **Active membership**: Higher in France, lower in Germany.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Churn and Customer Attitudes\n",
    "- **Churn** is higher among older, disengaged customers.\n",
    "- **Exited customers** often have wider balance ranges and lower engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Feature Importance (Churn Prediction)\n",
    "- **Top predictors** of churn:  \n",
    "  `Age`, `Estimated Salary`, `Credit Score`, `Balance`, `Number of Products`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Segmentation (Cluster Analysis)\n",
    "- **Customer clusters by geography** show at least 4 distinct segments with differing churn tendencies, product usage, and demographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Target older and inactive members for **engagement campaigns**.\n",
    "2. Explore **product bundling opportunities** to increase multi-product ownership.\n",
    "3. Prioritize **France** as it holds the largest, most stable customer base.\n",
